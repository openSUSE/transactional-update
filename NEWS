Copyright (C) 2016-2019 Thorsten Kukuk et al.

Version 2.21

  submounts into the update environment

Version 2.20.4
* Mount efivarfs on EFI systems to make sure the bootloader will be installed
  correctly.
* Fix removal of existing overlay directories

Version 2.20.3

Version 2.20

  used to perform multiple operations before rebooting into the new state
* Make sure the dracut service to print warnings on /etc overlay conflicts
  also runs in the pre-made images

Version 2.16
* Use default command if options, but no command was given [boo#1146116]
* Make sure only one process appears in `ps` output [boo#1111897]
* Move update check: If a new repository is added (and
  ZYPPER_AUTO_IMPORT_KEYS is set) adding the new repository key won't fail any
  more
* Avoid unnecessary snapshots / reboots by detecting zypper operations
  without changes more reliably (e.g. when installing an already installed
  package)
* Update the manpage accordingly
* Get rid of Perl dependency
* Building documentation requires Python 3 now
* Bugfixes:
  * Ignore commented lines in fstab when checking for shadowed files

* Warn user if contents of /var have been changed

Version 2.13.2
* Add hooks for telemetrics

Version 2.13.1
* Bugfix: Clean up empty /etc snapshot directories again

Version 2.13
* Fix a serious data loss problem (deleting all files in /etc
  overlays) in case /var/lib/overlay/etc is not part of any snapshot
  any more.
* Avoid error message in case a system has no /etc/fstab.sys

Version 2.12
* Implements support for needs-restart (Fate#326451)
* Adds easy rollback to last known working snapshot by using "last"
  as the snapshot number
* Migrate /etc/fstab.sys entires to /etc/fstab for systemd being
  able to create mount units; this will prevent errors on unmount
  during shutdown for /var and /etc
* Remove implicit --no-allow-vendor-change - this option can be
  configured in zypper's configuration file now
* Add support for mounting the /etc overlay file system as a systemd
  unit in /etc/fstab on a read-only system (replacing /etc/fstab.sys
  in the long run)
* Various bugfixes:
  * Only remove /etc overlays on read-only root file systems
    [boo#1122455]
  * Disable "Persistent" flag in systemd timer unit to prevent
    updates during or immediately after the boot phase
  * Don't set global zypper options during migration - this is not

  * Filter out security.selinux attributes during rsync

Version 2.11
* Update man page to explain new /etc overlay handling
* Add special handling for migrating away from old overlay directory
* Read default update method for systemd service from config file
  (boo#1111321)

Version 2.10
* Introduce /etc overlays
  * Each root file system snapshot now has a dedicated /etc overlay in
    /var/lib/snapshots/<snapshot number>/etc
  * Changes in older snapshots will be visible in newer snapshots (if
    the file hasn't been changed in both snapshots), but not the other
    way around; this makes it possible to roll back to a previous
    snapshot even if the configuration is broken
  * The /etc state of the oldest active snapshot will be synchronized
    into the new snapshot to prevent ever growing overlays
  * Removed creation of /etc backup snapshots
  * Removed complex overlayfs cleanup handling during dracut early boot;
    only thing left is to output a warning if files have been changed
    in old and new overlay after snapshot creation
  * Unused overlays will be removed during "cleanup" operation
* Add compatibility with snapper >= 0.7.0
* Correctly detect BTRFS ID when using multiple snapper configurations
* Fix disappearing prompt in "shell" command when application was updated
* Prevent accidental rollback on fast reboots (boo#1111786)
* Use zypper attribute packages-to-change if available (boo#1105992 &
  boo#1097619)
* Add kexec as reboot alternative
* Added explicit --with-doc / --without-doc build configure opttions for
  enforcing or excluding documentation build
* Removed precompiled documentation (boo#1088676)
* Added more dependency checks to configure script

  filter
* Small bugfixes for cleanup in error situations
* Fix possible incorrect detection of snapshots numbers during cleanup
* Mention parent in snapshot description

Version 2.6
* Add --interactive and --non-interactive options to change the default
  interactivity for zypper calls. For previously non-interactive calls (e.g.
  dup) these options makes it possible to pick the correct solution in case
  of conflicts or make sure that a script will never be stuck at an input
  prompt.
* Add kured reboot support
* Tries to clean up temporary files and mount points if transactional-update
  quits unexpectedly
* Remove trancactional-update-helper (replaced by zypper options)
* Create /var/lib/zypp if not available (boo#1104452)
* Add compatibility with new zypper versions (boo#1105992)
* Various small fixes

Version 2.5
* Support for overlayfs attributes like trusted.overlay.opaque - this will
  avoid disappearing configuration files on system updates
* Documentation update
* Only sync /etc if it's on an overlayfs mount
* Use correct locale for zypper - thus updating locale specific packages and
  avoiding "empty" updates where transactional-update didn't see the change
