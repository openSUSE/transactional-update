* SELinux: Fixed changing the wrong grub configuration file
* SELinux: Move /.autorelabel file to writeable location

Version 2.28
* Add 'setup-selinux' command for easy setup of a SELinux system
* Allow complex commands for the 'run' command
* SELinux: Fix /etc / overlay labeling

Version 2.27
* Add support for network systemd-resolvd network connections in t-u

* Check that mount options don't exceed maximum length

Version 2.25.1
* Fix inotify watcher setup
* Use log_{info,error} for more messages to avoid messing up Salt logs

Version 2.25
* Reduce number of overlays:
  Instead of using transparent overlays for all previous layers only add the
  previous snapshot's overlay; this will greatly reduce the number of overlays
  while still making sure that /etc changes in the running system will be
  visible in the next snapshot
* When using --drop-if-no-change synchronize potential /etc changes with
  running system
* Exclude all non-root-fs mounts from inotify watcher

  perfomed (BETA, required for Salt integration)

  correctly.
* Fix removal of existing overlay directories

Version 2.20.3

  [boo#1160213]

Version 2.20
* Add the option `--continue` to extend an existing snapshot; this can be

  without changes more reliably (e.g. when installing an already installed
  package)
* Update the manpage accordingly
* Get rid of Perl dependency
* Building documentation requires Python 3 now
* Bugfixes:
  * Ignore commented lines in fstab when checking for shadowed files

  any more.
* Avoid error message in case a system has no /etc/fstab.sys

Version 2.12
* Implements support for needs-restart (Fate#326451)
* Adds easy rollback to last known working snapshot by using "last"
  as the snapshot number
* Migrate /etc/fstab.sys entires to /etc/fstab for systemd being
  able to create mount units; this will prevent errors on unmount
  during shutdown for /var and /etc
* Remove implicit --no-allow-vendor-change - this option can be
  configured in zypper's configuration file now
* Add support for mounting the /etc overlay file system as a systemd
  unit in /etc/fstab on a read-only system (replacing /etc/fstab.sys
  in the long run)
* Various bugfixes:
  * Only remove /etc overlays on read-only root file systems
    [boo#1122455]
  * Disable "Persistent" flag in systemd timer unit to prevent
    updates during or immediately after the boot phase
  * Don't set global zypper options during migration - this is not

  (boo#1111321)

Version 2.10
* Introduce /etc overlays
  * Each root file system snapshot now has a dedicated /etc overlay in
    /var/lib/snapshots/<snapshot number>/etc
  * Changes in older snapshots will be visible in newer snapshots (if
    the file hasn't been changed in both snapshots), but not the other
    way around; this makes it possible to roll back to a previous
    snapshot even if the configuration is broken
  * The /etc state of the oldest active snapshot will be synchronized
    into the new snapshot to prevent ever growing overlays
  * Removed creation of /etc backup snapshots
  * Removed complex overlayfs cleanup handling during dracut early boot;
    only thing left is to output a warning if files have been changed
    in old and new overlay after snapshot creation

* Correctly detect BTRFS ID when using multiple snapper configurations

* Use zypper attribute packages-to-change if available (boo#1105992 &
  boo#1097619)

  enforcing or excluding documentation build

  filter

* Fix possible incorrect detection of snapshots numbers during cleanup
* Mention parent in snapshot description

Version 2.6
* Add --interactive and --non-interactive options to change the default
  interactivity for zypper calls. For previously non-interactive calls (e.g.
  dup) these options makes it possible to pick the correct solution in case
  of conflicts or make sure that a script will never be stuck at an input
  prompt.
* Add kured reboot support
* Tries to clean up temporary files and mount points if transactional-update
  quits unexpectedly
* Remove trancactional-update-helper (replaced by zypper options)
* Create /var/lib/zypp if not available (boo#1104452)
* Add compatibility with new zypper versions (boo#1105992)
* Various small fixes

Version 2.5
* Support for overlayfs attributes like trusted.overlay.opaque - this will
  avoid disappearing configuration files on system updates
* Documentation update
